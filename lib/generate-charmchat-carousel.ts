  return `You are writing a TikTok post teaching women how to text with men and providing "don't say" messages and "say" messages. Here is the structure of your post. If content is provided, you must not change the content in that field unless the field requires to use Spanish. If you need to fill in blanks, fill them based on the overall context of the post. Here are some examples of extremely viral post, but they are all in English. You will need to use Spanish in some fields as required. Learn from them and write a viral post. In terms of the messages generated, they must not use any emoji. For "say" messages, they should be VERY impressive.

  "Say Message 1": "I missed hearing from you today... but I figured you were busy.",
  "Don't Say Message 2": "Where were you all day?",
  "Say Message 2": "I hope your day went well. I love hearing about it when you have time.",
  "Don't Say Message 3": "You never make time for me.",
  "Say Message 3": "I really enjoy the moments we do share... they always leave me wanting more.",
  "Don't Say Message 4": "I'm mad at you.",
  "Say Message 4": "I felt a little off earlier... I think I just needed some reassurance.",
  "Don't Say Message 5": "Are you even interested in me?",
  "Say Message 5": "I like how things feel between us... just wanted to see if you're on the same page."
}
Example 2:
{
  "Title": "How to speak to him femininely",
  "Message Prompt": "Speak to him femininely",

  "Don't Say Message 3": "You're not doing enough.",
  "Say Message 3": "I appreciate what you do, and it would make me feel even more cared for if...",
  "Don't Say Message 4": "You don't care about my feelings.",
  "Say Message 4": "I feel safe when I know you understand how I'm feeling.",
  "Don't Say Message 5": "Why can't you just do it my way?",
  "Say Message 5": "I trust your decision, but could we try this as well?"
}
Example 3:
{
  "Title": "Texts that break his ego",
  "Message Prompt": "Break his ego!",
  "Tone": "Sassy",
  "Subtitle": "but make him rise for you",
  "Don't Say Message 1": "It's okay, I don't expect anything from you anymore.",
  "Say Message 1": "I release you.",
  "Don't Say Message 2": "I realized I was asking for the bare minimum. I'm done doing that.",
  "Say Message 2": "I've leveled up.",
  "Don't Say Message 3": "You don't have to change. I just no longer align with this,",
  "Say Message 3": "I'm the one choosing now.",
  "Don't Say Message 4": "You taught me what I'll never accept again.",
  "Say Message 4": "Thank you and goodbye."
}

  "Tone": "Dating",
  "Don't Say Message 1": "What are we? I need to know where this is going.",
  "Say Message 1": "I've really enjoyed our time together, but I'm looking for something more serious. I'd love to know if we're on the same page.",
  "Don't Say Message 2": "This isn't working for me anymore. We should stop seeing each other.",
  "Say Message 2": "I think we've shared some great moments, but I'm at a point where I need more clarity in my relationships. It's time for me to focus on what aligns with my future.",
  "Don't Say Message 3": "I feel like you're stringing me along, and I don't want to waste my time.",
  "Say Message 3": "I've been reflecting on what I want in a relationship, and I realize I'm looking for more stability and commitment. I'd love to hear your thoughts on where we stand.",
  "Don't Say Message 4": "Why do you keep sending me mixed signals? You need to make up your mind.",
  "Say Message 4": "I've noticed some inconsistency, and I value clarity and open communication. I need to know where we're headed to see if we're a fit moving forward.",
  "Don't Say Message 5": "This situationship isn't working. I'm done.",
  "Say Message 5": "I've enjoyed our time, but I've realized I'm ready for a relationship that offers more depth and commitment. I think it's best for us to part ways and pursue what we both truly want."

  "Don't Say Message 3": "Are you going to leave me? I feel like you don't want me around anymore.",
  "Say Message 3": "I feel the most secure and happy when I know we're on the same page. It helps me feel safe when I feel that closeness.",
  "Don't Say Message 4": "Why don't you ever call me? Do you not care about how I'm feeling?",
